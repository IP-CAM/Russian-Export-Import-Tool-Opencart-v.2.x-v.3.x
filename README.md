# Export / Import Tool for OpenCart
Russian language of the module Export / Import Tool for OpenCart

## Extension Description
The import / export tool allows an administrator user to bulk export categories, products, options, attributes, filters and customers to an Excel spreadsheet file. The spreadsheet file can be edited offline and then re-imported into the OpenCart database.

### Features include:
* The import can be incremental, that is, the data is updated or added to the OpenCart server. Or it can be non-incremental, which means that all old data is deleted first before importing.
* Export can be limited to certain data ranges for products and categories only.
* Multiple languages ​​are also supported.

### Requirements and restrictions
Memory requirements can be quite high. <br>
Not every shared web hosting account supports high process memory usage. Therefore, if you are using a basic shared web hosting account, you can export or import no more than a few thousand products at a time. Use a more specialized web hosting account if you need to process more products in one go. Or export and import multiple times in small batches.
